# Note-Taker-App
// Small project just for fun
// Used more advanced DOM manipulation for this even though it was relatively simple
// I am still learning about creating, appending, and removing elements in javascript 
// There are some fixes I may make in the future such as moving the submit button and form below the div where
//All of the notes are projected so there is no overlap when many notes are projected in the interface


Recent commit:
Implemented local storage and a new button that allows you to remove all notes from local storage
